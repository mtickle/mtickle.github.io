# About Me


I have been in the software development industry since 1996 and have worked in a variety of roles, from developer to manager. My cover letter is generic with such terms as "I have a passion for technology" and "I enjoy learning new things." And while those things are true, my real strength is my ability to make connections with people and to solve complex problems, either as the one pressing the buttons, or as the one providing leadership, guidance, and encouragement to others.

Having been in the software industry since the "dot com bubble", I have seen successes and failures and learned from it all. I speak code, but as a former military journalist, I also speak human. I can help the non-techies understand the tech and be empathetic to everyone's needs. I love my line of work and have chosen to focus in public safety, passionately assisting our front-line heroes in their mission to protect and serve through software. If you will take away anything from this paragraph, take away this: I always seek to turn a moment of frustration into a positive experience that impresses every customer with kindness, empathy, and professionalism.

# Behind the Scenes

Above all, I am a servant and follower of Jesus Christ. I believe in Him and have accepted Him as my Lord and Savior. I strive to live my life in a way that is both pleasing and acceptible to Jesus, and God our Father. I am a dad to three wonderful children and a husband to an amazing wife. We have made our home in southeastern Wake County, North Carolina, and have filled it with dogs, one cat, and an impressive Lego collection. You may see me on any given weekend at a dance competition or gymnastics meet.

When I am not busy at my day job, I enjoy writing and playing music. In fact, I play keyboards in the praise team at Wendell Baptist Church. While I am self-taught at both piano and guitar, I am proficient in neither. I also enjoy playing video games and have been an Xbox gamer since 2020. My video game obsessions are "Star Wars: Outlaws", "Jedi: Survivor", and the Forza Horizon series.
