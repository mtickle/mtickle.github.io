                    <p>
                        I have been in the software development industry since 1996 and
                        have worked in a variety of roles, from developer to manager. My
                        cover letter is generic with such terms as "I have a passion for
                        technology" and "I enjoy learning new things." And while those
                        things are true, my real strength is my ability to make
                        connections with people and to solve complex problems, either as
                        the one pressing the buttons, or as the one providing leadership,
                        guidance, and encouragement to others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Having been in the software industry since the "dot com bubble", I
                        have seen successes and failures and learned from it all. I speak
                        code, but as a former military journalist, I also speak human. I
                        can help the non-techies understand the tech and be empathetic to
                        everyone's needs. I love my line of work and have chosen to focus
                        in public safety, passionately assisting our front-line heroes in
                        their mission to protect and serve through software. If you will
                        take away anything from this paragraph, take away this:
                        <i>I always seek to turn a moment of frustration into a positive
                            experience that impresses every customer with kindness, empathy,
                            and professionalism</i>.

                        Above all, I am a servant and follower of Jesus Christ. I believe
                        in Him and have accepted Him as my Lord and Savior. I strive to
                        live my life in a way that is both pleasing and acceptible to
                        Jesus, and God our Father. I am a dad to three wonderful children
                        and a husband to an amazing wife. We have made our home in
                        southeastern Wake County, North Carolina, and have filled it with
                        dogs, one cat, and an impressive Lego collection. You may see me
                        on any given weekend at a dance competition or gymnastics meet.

                        When I am not busy at my day job, I enjoy writing and playing
                        music. In fact, I play keyboards in the praise team at Wendell
                        Baptist Church. While I am self-taught at both piano and guitar, I
                        am proficient in neither. I also enjoy playing video games and
                        have been an Xbox gamer since 2020. My video game obsessions are
                        "Star Wars: Outlaws", "Jedi: Survivor", and the Forza Horizon
                        series.

                <p>
                    At SAS, I serve as a technical team lead for technical support and implementation of the SAS Law Enforcement and Intelligence Solution. 
                    There is lots of Linux and configration management in play. I also maintain CJIS certification and law enforcement security clearances in several states. My expertise here 
                    is in student safety programs, reporting, eGuardian integrations and intelligence gathering.

                <h4>Manager, Product Development</h4>
                <p>
                    I joined JAGGER when it was still called SciQuest. I walked in the door as an application developer in support, then became a product owner, and then left as a manager of 
                    product development teams. I lead multiple teams of anywhere from eight to 20 people through four major releases with zero defects in the release cycle. As a 
                    product owner, I was responsible for the development of the first version of the JAGGAER Spend Director.

                   In my brief but adventurous time at MedThink, I was responsible for the development of C# and jQuery modules for the Sitefinity CMS. This was primarily 
                   used for pharmaceutical marketing and advertising. Some key take-aways here was my use of continuous integration tools like Beanstalk and Git, along with 
                   mass marketing tools like Bronto. There were also many creative meetings with advertising teams in hip and trendy office spaces.

                    CISYS was a brief stop in my career. It had an exciting start-up feel to it, where I was responsible for the update of a VB.NET web application to use 
                    proper database strategies and added functionality. I was also brought in to a PHP calendaring application for a local university.

                    Much like my experience at JAGGAER, I started at Syneos Health when it was called by a different name as a software developer and left as a manager of 
                    application development. I was one of four people in the first IT department of what was INC Research. I was responsible for the development of their 
                    first clinical trial management system, which included support for entire spectrum of clinical trials, from site visit reports, to patient recruitment, to 
                    investigator payments. I went on to manage a team of developers who grew the product beyond expectations.
