            <h2>Military Service</h2>
            <p>
                During my seven years of active duty service in the U.S. Army, I was
                trained as a military journalist and Public Affairs Specialist. This is
                the origin of my "I speak human" philosophyâ€”I wrote feature stories for{' '}
                <strong>The Pentagram</strong> newspaper, served as a Regimental
                Photographer at the White House and Pentagon, and acted as a media
                liaison. This communications role quickly evolved with the rise of the
                early internet. I designed and built "<strong>BandLink</strong>," the U.S.
                Army Band's first website, which became the official model for military
                web presences and was demonstrated to a four-star general. This
                pioneering work led to me helping develop web policy, building other
                command sites with JavaScript, managing large-scale databases (FoxPro,
                Access), and serving as a <strong>team leader</strong>. This unique
                blend of communications and technical problem-solving set the
                foundation for my entire civilian career.
